## How to use

Clone the repo to your desired folder with the following git command

```git clone https://github.com/noneuclideanmotion/LSCB.git```

Now go into the \/deps folder and run the following git command to download the dependencies.

```git clonehttps://github.com/yourWaifu/sleepy-discord.git```

Download the open SSL Library [64 Bit](https://slproweb.com/download/Win64OpenSSL-1_1_1j.exe) or [32 Bit](https://slproweb.com/download/Win32OpenSSL-1_1_1j.exe). If you are using linux, use your package manager and install libssl-dev or openssl-devel.

You can now run the cmake file in the root directory with your favourite compiler/IDE and build the bot.

When your bot is built you will need a token to run it. In the \/config folder create a new file with no file extension named "token". Write to this file the token data. If you wish to push a commit to the bot, this file will not be exposed - so don't worry.
